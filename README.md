A custom built portfolio website for [Derek Mohr](https://www.instagram.com/onemohrtimedesign/), a creative director and designer from Grand Rapids, Michigan. It had been rebuilt in this same repository many times, all the way back to 2016!

This theme is based on the `onemohrtime/timber-starter-theme`, which is open-source and encouraged for you to use as well. The repository can be found in [my repositories](https://github.com/OneMohrTime/timber-starter-theme).
