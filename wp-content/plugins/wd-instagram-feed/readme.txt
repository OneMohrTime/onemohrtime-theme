Have you ever wanted to display images from Instagram on your webpages? Is simple integration not enough for your WordPress website? Do you want to display composite feeds of hashtags and users? Do you prefer to show instagram content with your custom styling? Have you ever thought it will be cool to repost your Instagram feed to WP blog? Instagram Feed WD is your best solution with its user-friendly management and easy set up. It is simply the most useful and functional WordPress Instagram plugin.

Instagram Feed WD allows displaying Instagram feeds based on public Instagram accounts and hashtags. You can create mixed feeds based on multiple accounts, multiple hashtags or any combination of both with Pro version.  WordPress Instagram plugin uses 4 layouts - 2 layouts for smaller thumbnail display  (Thumbnail and Masonry) and 2 for larger images (Blog Style and Image Browser). Thumbnail view displays images with their metadata (Pro): caption, number of likes and comments. Image Browser displays single image with navigation possibility, metadata (Pro): image caption, number of likes and comments. Masonry (Pro) layout displays images in beautiful masonry view combining the image and its metadata (Pro). Blog Style (Pro) layout combines large image with  its data similar creating a blog style display. All the layouts can display feed username and its metadata (bio, number of posts and followers).

Use Conditional Filters to display filtered feeds (Pro). Set up a filter logic (to hide or display posts), choose condition type (username, hashtag, mention,description, Instagram media link), fill in condition and display filtered feeds. Feeds can have multiple filters.

Images can be redirected to Instagram or opened in a lightbox. You can set sorting for the images (date, likes, comments, random) as well as define the order (ascending/descending). In case of combined feeds you can use front-end filtering by clicking on specific hashtag or username. The lightbox display images as a slideshow with different transition effects (Pro). In Pro version of this Instagram plugin media caption, comments, social share buttons and filmstrip also can be shown in the lightbox, making it an elegant advanced tool for viewing Instagram feed.

Theme section (available with Pro version) allows to customize colors, sizes and display styles. Each layout uses its own theme which makes this section even more compelling.

No feed data is stored in the database. All the images, videos (Pro), captions and comments  are retrieved directly from the Instagram in the front-end, which makes this WordPress Instagram plugin fast and very easy to use.

Custom Javascript can be found within the same location of Instagram WD.

A Custom Javascript event is available for scripts to run after all Instagram feed images are loaded.
Suppose you have feed with thumbnails view and besides displaying your feed you want to open up captions for some photos. You can achieve this by assigning our custom wdi_feed_loaded event to feed container and set callback function for that event.
Here is quick example how to open up captions for images with 0,1,2,3 indexes.
jQuery('#wdi_feed_0').on('wdi_feed_loaded',function(){
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(0).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(1).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(2).trigger('click');
    jQuery('.wdi_photo_title').eq(3).trigger('click');
  });
